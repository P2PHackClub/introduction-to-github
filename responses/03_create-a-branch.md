## Creating a branch

You just learned how to create a branch—the first step in the GitHub flow.

Branches are an important part of the GitHub flow because they allow us to separate our work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.

### Tips for using branches

A single project can have hundreds of branches, each suggesting a new change to the `main` branch.

The best way to keep branches organized with a team is to keep them concise and short-lived. In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors when branches are only active for a few days before they’re merged <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge)</sup> into the `main` branch.
