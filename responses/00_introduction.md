# :wave: Heyyyyyy! Welcome to the party on GitHub :confetti_ball:

## This is P2P Hack Club's Introduction to GitHub

Written by JP and Reema, this hopefully should be working by the time the meeting has started. Let us know if there are any issues you come across! :smile:

> **Orpheus:** Hey! So..... I have a problem. I am making a slide deck for my science project, and... tbh I need a \*\*lot\*\* of help. I'm hosting it on GitHub, can you go in and make some changes?

## **Mission Start!**

To help Orpheus with their science project, you're going to need some knowledge of the hosting platform that they're using, GitHub.

## Soo... what is GitHub?

I'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?

GitHub is a code-hosting platform for collaboration. GitHub is a place where anyone can contribute to develop their favorite software, file bug reports, and create their own projects!

It simplifies the process of collaborating with other people, and makes it easy to collaborate on projects.

All of these projects are **open-source**, which is a type of computer software in which source code is avaliable to view freely online.

Some of your favorite pieces of software, like Firefox, Android, Chrome (based on Chromium), and more are built with open source. If you want to see the source code of your browser, or your phone, you can find it easily online, and even contribute to it!

*You can actually sync your repl.it projects (remember your Discord bots?) to GitHub, and allow anyone to edit and view the source! You could even ask other people to write features for you, or take bug reports!*

**So, version control??**

GitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.

Think of version control like Google Doc's history tab. It's a log of every change to your code.

**NASA FTW!!!!**

GitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!

## Exploring a GitHub repository

:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)

### More features

The video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:

- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub
- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation
- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:
  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that’s in-progress in this project dashboard
  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work

### Special Files

In the video you learned about a special file called the `README.md`. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:

- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.
- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.

### Using issues

This is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.

Issue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.


<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>

## Using GitHub issues

Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place
- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions
