## Help publish Orpheus's website for their science project, using the GitHub Flow!

GitHub is a code-hosting platform for collaboration. GitHub is a place where anyone can contribute to develop their favorite software, file bug reports, and create their own projects!

It simplifies the process of collaborating with other people, and makes it easy to collaborate on projects.

All of these projects are **open-source**, which is a type of computer software in which source code is avaliable to view freely online.

Some of your favorite pieces of software, like Firefox, Android, Chrome (based on Chromium), and more are built with open source. If you want to see the source code of your browser, or your phone, you can find it easily online, and even contribute to it!
