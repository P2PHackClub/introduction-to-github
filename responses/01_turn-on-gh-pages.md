> **Orpheus:** Right, so I see that you assignned yourself to the project :smile:. Thank you sooooooo much! So, I'm have some code in my repository for a website, but I don't know how to get it from GitHub to publish onto the web! Can you help me?

## Let's use GitHub Pages

Now, on to business! GitHub Pages allow you to serve a static site from a repository. We've filled this repository with some site content, but the rendered site isn't visible right now. Let's change that.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Click on the [**Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings) tab in this repository
1. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
1. From the "Source" drop down, select **main branch**

> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes.

<h3 align="center">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>

> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.
